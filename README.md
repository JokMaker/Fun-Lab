# Contributing to Zero to mastery fun lab repo

This is a guide to making your first pull request using github

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

## Steps

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Clone the repository you have forked (Appears in the repository section of your profile)
3. Checkout to a new branch. (Optional if you don't have a concept of branching)
4. Change in `users.js` add your github username in the above json array. Note: Make sure you place your username is exactly as it appears on github
5. Commit the changes
6. Create a PR to the original repository. Here is how you do it:
